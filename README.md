#Modules

Modular documentation for Ethereum. 

This project is built entirely in LaTeX. This project aims to provide complete, coherent, modular documentation for Ethereum. Topic folders with the file "template.tex" in them are entries that still need to be created. Each module should be 1 to 3 pages in length and follow the format already laid out in the template.tex files inside each module directory. Formatting is critical. When defining formal math operations, prefer pseudocode. 

The three main directories are fundamental, integral, and occipital. Fundamental contains the most basic Ethereum concepts that easily translate into regular language. Integral contains core Ethereum concepts that outline the whole of its operation. Occipital  contains concepts that have a broad range of applications and use cases and are not specific just to Ethereum.


Several but not all of the various resources cited can be found in the references/ directory.
